Read the free tutorial series in *Towards Data Science*:

- Part 1: [High-level engine applied to tennis ball and basketball drop, etc.](https://towardsdatascience.com/perfect-infinite-precision-game-physics-in-python-part-2-360cc445a197)
- Part 2: [The program makes a philosophy discovery by simulating a billiards break.](https://towardsdatascience.com/perfect-infinite-precision-game-physics-in-python-part-2-360cc445a197)
- Part 3: [Creating the low-level engine using SymPy, including setting up the physics equations (some are tricky) and getting SymPy to do the rest of the work.](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/perfect-infinite-precision-game-physics-in-python-part-3-9ea9043e3969)
- Part 4, how to speed up the engine a bit (but not enough) and limitations (not yet published).

See requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt for dependencies.

Note that pydub requires ffmpeg to be installed on your system.

Note that moviepy requires ffmpeg to be installed on your system.

Let me know if there is interest in a more automated install process.
